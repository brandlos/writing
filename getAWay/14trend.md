With my inside wife I had been ferried here as if dead. I can only bring two bags to the airport. I want you to remember the first thing you knew about me. This is another happy story now.

On the plane a small boy spilled wine into my lap—a wide red stain.

It’s OK! I’ll be gone of all small marks in a new land.

But underneath: the horizon? I’ve waited to emerge from this cold and long thing, and finally it’s time. Inside: vending machine. French girl. Free latrine. Old friends. They try to be seen pragmatically.

Again, on a bus to somewhere new. Here’s that French girl. She’s a  proponent of some indulgence. She’s maybe just lazy. She was approached by me, trying not to be an envoy. She sat on her tanned gladstone; was fixing a kink in her sock; said, “I can feel my home following me;” seemed to be chewing on her lip.

And here’s that boy! It’s OK. But I scolded him.

He said, “Black ruins of my life rise into view.”

That gives it away.

For one unsheathing a cutlery set, it’s fine to rip the little napkin tab in the process. They put forks on the left here, too. I dropped the knife onto a boot. There was, wasn’t there?, the promise of something to be opened. Wasn’t there just a fine film covering the window? OK.

It cost so much. I can’t cut it for its stiffness. I am fumbling with the shears. I dropped them. I like to be quiet. I am turning. I can feel myself changing. I am getting a way.
