# Common Amenity

Something happened to them that was bad. The bridge collapsed, or the new way of living was unsustainable and they all had to go home.

I wasn’t one of them, though. We were just driving back to my mother’s amid the migration. Throngs of people walking, dusty Phoenix landscape, lone rock guitar strum, et cetera. Slogging along mostly. I puffed a dust cloud out as I passed them, crowd by crowd, movie-style.

We were dog and me. I could hear my mother’s voice. Whenever I was back in Phoenix I took a back seat. She would bark out her compliments to me. As she talked, she would jingle a low chain by her fine breasts and my drink would be sweating. It would be hot. The tone would be: a fight. She would say it was late, I had strayed.

I was reminded of my bedroom window. Nearby, through it, the childhood sweetheart was a pressure. I recalled prolonged fretting, a floating curtain.

I wasn’t there yet, but I had to get out of the house. I had to take care of my dog. I parked along a suburban street corner and hitched her to my hip—with a carabiner.

We headed along the white walk toward town.

I thought of Marla, my mother, who was surely in her chair. I thought of her riding, sipping, and stitching. I thought of her making arms out of it. I had called my mother and I had talked to her and I knew from the sound of it that there had been a transgression.

At the first corner cafe was the spot where I got this ceramic cup and at the next was where I had it filled. A low bowl of water quenched the dog.

My mother came back. I think about her still, scooping me up, using a licked thumb to wipe whatever off. Once, she stopped. There was codependence. There was seepage. My heartache will not stand on recall.

At the core of the city was a square. A local monument was sheathed within a candle, for the holidays. This was December. My dog was panting now. I scooped her up and walked us to a bench. A mother is a common amenity. I was thinking about that.

To beat around the bush, I put it plainly. I prefer to communicate with gestures. I accepted the terms of my own proposal.

My dog and me, our leg veins were white and taut like wart fibers and easily sliced and plucked. The severing of the limbs was iconoclastic.

Regarding my mother, I had been trying to do exactly what she was doing but I ended up failing and doing something else.
