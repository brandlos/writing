# I Could Have Been Satisfied

No, he didn’t order it, and so I called a superior in spite of his own authority and asked to get it shipped away. This time it was a joint expenditure between himself and Bronwyn but I’m only looking for him, for Ready, who comes here to chew, who knows me.

Once I returned a wedding band to him in Sarasota, no, in Rome, New York. His eyes were the shape of mouths. He had pursed eyes. He was an ardent observer of society’s ills. Have you seen his photo?

He did some research with the Broad Street Children’s Center. He took it to Congress. Secrets had once kept him in thrall, but I didn’t distrust him, anyway. He is an academic and he told me he told me the truth.

What might be condensed from this—a moral—a premonition—fairer judgment—I missed them, I think, when I declined to help him get the old wood play set put back up after the quake. The new set had come, I mentioned, but he hadn’t ordered it. There were things like this always, coming and coming and turning back unclaimed.

And Ready took other lovers, as well—Holly—Jack, Kim—Michael—Michelle?—coming and turning away. And I used them as points of reference for improvement. And when I saw the shape that means sex has happened is when I returned the band.

Are you Ready? I could have been satisfied. Yes, I could be anyone. There are so many ways to settle for love it brings the god-awful back.
