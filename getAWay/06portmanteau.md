# Portmanteau

The day it is later revealed I am frequently expecting, I see him crossing the street. I don't recognize him anymore with his rad cut which gives him a radish head.

He, Abner, is an axis of my two long moments. His nerves give him rote speech or a high compliance. He is snugly fit, warm, with a revolving countenance. He shouldn’t be looked at head-on.

My hug with him, on his toes, on 2nd and Market, has the smell of salt meat, from the meat stall. And here's a tall feat: he invites me to see an act at the Trocadero.

He says, "Alone isn't how I'm going."

He says, "Against my better judgment, I want another." He wears the cherry staff polo and his sizing-me-up jacket and he, well, he is still an up-and-coming kind of boy and he abstains from some usual sociopolitics.

Get this: I miss it. It has been long enough that I cannot be prudent. (And I have already flushed my gut.)

It makes you sick to picture it, but we cab to the venue.

The act is called Long Chop. They're good to like when you're small. They play my favorite hits. I get my money's worth of movement.

You know what it's called when this moment of the story comes.

In the bathroom, Abner’s parts are brought out for a time and I am scrubbing myself across his loins and he runs away after! Up and away! And I am lying, I am lying and I say, "It's best just to get on with the softening of it, already.”
