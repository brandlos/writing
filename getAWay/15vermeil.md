Numbers have a relation to one less than what makes them whole when a decimal is involved. I’m saying: be thankful for ugly blessings. Although I don’t like you, somebody will.

Carrying my ermine—that is, my carmine—tote bag is a chore I’m happy to endure. At the crossroads I met with Brandon and we had a brief exchange. He took that red bag from me and walked down town to the St. David’s station.

To be frank, he stole it. I never got it back and that’s one of many things I’ll have learned from him.

The bag was ancient and ugly and I had affixed rollers to it so it could be tugged along. Inside were my crime reports and some food, so I was out on them, too.

Inside was a secret about one or all of them that could lead to mine or the bad guy’s demise. I am not a crime solver, but I like to try get to know them like that. I want do a lot of good.

...If I ask you, will you be honest? I feel like I’m counterfeit. I hope I’m not too overt about it. To be frank, I don’t like you but I know you’ve done well for yourself. Any new input will get me closer to the good me. I want to be any way. No matter. You know. “I” is someone else.
