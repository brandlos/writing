# Bárbaro

The last time it was managed to be eaten it had been cooked cleanly, with the right utensils, with the right seasonings, at the right time of day, with the right flourishes and the right way to set the oven before careful insertion.

The creature was fleshed and, cooking, crackling. Something about it aroused a genital feeling, originating in the palate.

It was a compromise or maybe a fine display of mediocrity. 

In general, it was sliced in half or cubed or meant to be shredded but, rather, was torn freely or eaten whole or worried into a spongy bun.
