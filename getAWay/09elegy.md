# Elegy

So, I make a ritual of the ends of my enterings and of my beings-entered.

So, I make an exit in front of this slow, quickening thing.

I make a left turn away from this unfamiliar suburb.

I am like a man whom opportunity resists, for after making the call and when the last ass smell lingered in my passenger upholstery, I sat—coldly—steaming behind the rush on route twenty-two.

You’d be hard-pressed to know it.

“You should get comfortable,” said the man at my window. This was a still moment, still. I could tell this would be a lingering one.

I exited my car. I sat on my knees on the warm macadam for a stretch. I raised my hands toward the sky and counted to some odd number.

The next year, whenever I was stooping over or rolled onto my blades, or whenever I was being spread or pulled on or whenever I neared sexual climax I could close my eyes and envision how wrong it was to be devout in a temporary place.
