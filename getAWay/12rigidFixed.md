# Rigid, Fixed [1/2]

Just like that, upon passing, she expects to have the contents of her life laid out for her and evidently they are. She flushes. She jerks at her eyes, kneads at the place where her life should be.

It seems less a matter of time to her than of permission. On deck, her lime suit straps dig into her shoulders. She has an appetite for this kind of painful stimulation.

She blanches at the overall of the event. The water’s lapping is a forceful yielding. She has been trained to adjust the painted foot plate shredding at her heels, and, another thing, a burgeoning dump is ignored by her on the floor of her belly.

A way to be is a sudden rotation until impact. This is the first of a series.

She wasn’t as good at this kind of thing when she was still a girl, still a, uh, a person who used language to excuse enigmatic behavior.

What doesn’t happen when she finishes is a handshake or the appearance of a meaningful trifle. What does is the blurring of several textures on the wall and the contraction of a small crevice of nerve.

Until a synthetic flap of skin is removed to expose a more promising organ, she will consider herself well-endowed.
