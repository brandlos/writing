# Marestail

Get them cooling and get them going. On a Tuesday it's chopping up the greens gets them going. Cooling going far gets them these Tuesdays. Serve them on a porch where it's hot here even in the winter. Sorry to say Lara has no time to be served. She's got to get going. The greens come anyway. But—what’s that?—she makes a little fuss.

Mr. Rotten came with the salad and Lara waved: “I can’t eat this.” There was that breeze cooling through the marestail near the copper railing. There was that plasticized cloth flapping near her legs, near the table. “I have an appointment.” And she pointed, achingly, to her teeth.

“But it’s made,” Mr. Rotten said. There was the cooling and the chopping already, gotten going and done, the fresh tomato bulbs thrown in, too. Not to mention… “We make it for you every day!” Not to mention the right-tonged fork chosen appropriately from the small tool slats in back.

“I won’t have it. I need to show off my teeth,” is the reason Lara gave.

She took a thin pick to her teeth and scraped to prove it.

Mr. Rotten raised the dish. It was cooling. “You’ll have to pay and you’ll have to eat it, too,” he said.

But she stood and got going.

He escorted the salad back to a bad food bin. The suggestion was insulting. Anyway, he had been to a chiropractor once or twice and recently he regained some of his harder gumption.
