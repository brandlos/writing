# Lee For Her

Most of the time I meet Mara by Boscov's, on the stoop. Today I do that, on the stoop. I've got a coiffed hairstyle and I wear a nice bra, for my own sake.

She'll likely say something about her shift. She works the one after mine.

A different woman, a coworker, gets Mara razed daily. She is Lily, fitful and obscene. There is a baby growing inside of her hard, white and shiny as a tooth. She has the tiredness or the hunger that makes her feel wild and plainspoken and inside the store is kept too cold.

I'm in there now, I am so impatient. There is Lily leaning her breasts over the jewelry counter. She, saying: "I'll tell you what, Mar, it's coming from this crevice if it comes at all. I prayed for a year and I don't know it'll fit!"

I feel some pain upon seeing this intimacy and again have the urge to give Mara a little life of her own, but of course there are the basic symmetries of our biology preventing that.
