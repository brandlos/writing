# Bolivia

I add, This pullover I’m wearing my sister sent me from Bolivia. I add, She says when I wear it I look compact and pleasantly small. It’s got a pattern of flowers and to keep it fluffed you’ve got to use the excruciating adverb. 

I admit I am looking to get a reaction out of my neighbor, newspaper under his armpit, myself saying this across our fence. I want him to press into it, pleasantly. 

When I bike to the grocer's it's all performance. He knows I've left the front door unlocked. Sometimes I expect to find him with his plump skein of skin and his wife run out, waiting for me there on my ottoman. But because my speech is out of style (though maybe for something sinister) he only greets me across the bushes, in the morning, from his lawn. The meaning is: this is how it works.
