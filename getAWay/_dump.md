# Get A Way

He felt his own stupidity wash over him. It was like an inpouring of something rancid. He gagged. It was like the woman in FAO Schwarz had told him: He had come from nothing and he would always be nothing.

Joanie and her girlfriend, Yolk. Living in a small suburb. Everything run-down and a little gray. Think "setting of Wendy and Lucy" for environmental details. A wet Pacific-Northwest town, in the early summer. They're getting ready to go to a party and want to cause a little mischief on the way there. Joanie is the stronger of the two personalities but she's also much more sensitive.

When my burden approaches its limit I take a turn adopting the demeanor. Not today. Joanie is at the hors d'oeuvres, plucking olives out and crying. Joanie and I live in our room, in that studio near the Redner's. You'll learn.

I know I can be passive, but I'm not excruciating. The woman in the Wawa was wrong. She said nobody would love me because I spit in public sometimes, and yet here I am approaching Joanie. The night of our encounter I felt my own stupidity washing over me. It was like an inpouring of something rancid. I gagged. Not during. It was like the woman at the FAO Schwarz had said. I had come from nothing and I'd always be nothing.

But, then the smack. It was a temporary absolution from all responsibility. This will be the final joke. Take a look at my marvelous legs.
