# It Comes Down To My Having Second Thoughts About It

"I don't want him to be overborne," his mother keeps begging her phone, I mean, begging me. He goes to school to wrestle and meanwhile she leans on his friends. The school asks for exams and his span is so lean.

I am demanded once more in that off-focus way! I knew Ash, an honor, but only because he sought after me craftily. It was an under bleacher thing. It was a furtive ardor thing. There was the brief reconciliation before an abuse—the hunch, hunch, hunch and then sudden exhaustion—and he wanted me to manage it. I did. I tell her I'll go.

At Bloomsburg Ash airs himself out pleasantly. When he requests it I will bear it. (Repeat after me: I will give him the work and I will bear it.) The sky is a cloud threaded like a prim pants pocket button. The thing about these days is it's like some stupid renaissance and usually it comes down to my having second thoughts about it.
