# Ingenious Ancient Work

One: A child’s anger. That’s what it felt like. The panel was a misuse of funds. There was only one guest speaker and she cussed—an inappropriate advance. She was escorted out.

The panel took the form of a forum, eventually. It moved online to a dot-org address. There were moderators who became disillusioned with the promise of community. Two: low-level arousal. A distraction from the rock anthropology. There was havoc in the building lobby. Carnal needs were revealed. The carbon-dating lecture series was canceled. It stopped sorting data. It stopped drawing funds.

A series of mistakes. What’s as good is in any of them. Three: Anger. Anger. Anger. Put it away.
