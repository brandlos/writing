# White Mold

Once, there was a man who traveled up two flights of stairs because he lived there and I was his neighbor. This is the beginning. I mean, we were happening before, but now's where I'm talking about.

He's in the present. His legs don't really start until after his feet and they veer straight to his face and he has an ass on the way up. He makes an utter picture of himself. He likes to stay close to the floor because that's who he is. You know.

I had his key. Squatted in the rear of his room, he scrounged bright lint out from the rest of the dirt. He stood in his briefs, chewing, and then he gave me some. Don’t make me lug my penis out on you, you great one, I wanted to let him know.

The way he is always squinting takes me back to the time when I had been buffeted about by a similar man, another A, who knew how to work his own face. Never mind.

I slid the lint into its appropriate slit. He served arroz con gandules and there was green tamale water—you don’t drink that—I burned my hand on it evicting it from the microwave—they were good.

I said, “Maybe it’s better he drank the rum.” He said, “Help me choose the best profile photo to put first.” The site had men bounding on each other on the borders. I looked at the floor, of course.

Yes, there was the next time after that; yes, there was my retreat. I slinked home because I knew better. Who is over there making a pantomime of it all? And, didn’t I notice he had a boyish enthusiasm? 

It’s dangerous to go around telling yourself you’re the irreducible one, but I’m due to forget that. I have a skin tag. A stranger sees you and you’re flattened.
