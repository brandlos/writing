# Big Lug

Every day, I imagine what if I were beautiful, but I wash it off instead. Mercedes is, and when she appeared she helped to root the burning bush plucked from my grandmother's old estate—from her apartment. She makes it a rule to whip out all her charms and her niceties, one by one. She did it today, as always. Her hairstyle is sweeping and precise for this purpose, anyway.

I've never had have a knack for a long haul like that.

Down in the plot, there was a ceramic spade I intended to shove into the nearest close earth crack. I have an hour of every day to devote to putting up or knocking out things that will regrow—to some maintenance. Two of Mercedes' friends came to bang out the bush. I think it's easier to approach Cilio first with my great expectations, so I took his hand greedily.

"There aren't thorns but you'll need to pretend it can hurt you," I said.

"Show me the spot," he said. I said it was out back and that was the plan.

At night Cilio lives a town further out. I live in Wall. He lives in Brick. He squatted to inspect that loamy tract and I had a burning thought.

A good misstep is what comes in or out of it again at any cost for once. For good. I could have.

But it's Clyde who took up the rear position while I stood there, gutted. I promise it's not on purpose. The hedge ambled sidelong by me.

The bush has berries that you shouldn't eat. They're fertilized by some shit. In my fantasy I'd be better enough to negotiate my fingers into a shape that could fondle those and they are what I would have carried.
