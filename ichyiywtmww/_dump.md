You dealt a blow but I'm careful.

Hard stone lapping out

Trying to say myself.

Get at it.

Playground

The most honest version of it is that my own experience is what I'm thinking about when I show you the knowing face when you tell me about it. I have a harder time unless that's true because I have to at least conjure up the whole thing before I can understand. You told me about it and I wanted to be who can show it back.

It was good. I was good when I took out a morsel of some good humorâ€”a little bit. I wasn't when I carried it over to the next friend who was suffering. Usually I have to take a new approach but I don't come up with one in time.
