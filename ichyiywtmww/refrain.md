# Refrain

The way she walks?--she has a stubby stride.
I try my best not to do it, though
I like the prenatal lull of that trot,

though a working substitution of that
woman could be you, too, owing to
my usual tendency to match up with

whoever makes a quiet nook for me.
Settling into the grooves of someone.
I think I have a fluid foundation.

Anyway, I stretch more. There are too many
and things get all kinds of clung to me.
Pebbles and twigs fermenting in a brine.

The people living here are rapid-fire.
My brain is thrumming enough to lift
me out of this, so I get to hoisting. 

I'm talking big. I'm somewhere or other,
but you're here. I have to try out the
other side before I can decide where

I ought to be. But, now, where should I be?
I can't say. I can't say. I can't say.
I can't say. I can't say. I can't say.
I can't say. I can't say. I can't say.
