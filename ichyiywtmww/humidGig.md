# Humid Gig

The truth was like a dog. The wake wasn't frothy. The islands in the fog looked like fingerprint smears on a lens. This is a northern-state story, in Maine.

On the bus, the woman hauled her baby over each headrest. The baby whining more like a dog, her dog smelling more like a ferret. I was the one to offer her a spare seat when she wouldn't stop glancing side to side and sighing.

I was two-thirds through my trip, anyway. That is, I'm trying not to look for applause here. My new seatmate wore a pink lampshade bucket hat and a pair of Sperrys over tie-dyed socks, and was muttering into his phone, "I ended up bribing her to get away from the Lyft. I said, 'Fuck him, I want to give you double. I've got twenty minutes'." His smell was at least something that might have attracted me otherwise.

I'll go back a bit, now. Where I was leaving was Cranberry Island.

To see a spark of joy extinguished is the worst thing. That's what always causes anything. Moving away from maleness reminds others of when their sparks of joy were extinguished. But you can relight it. No one tells them that.

You need to dry it it out first but you can relight it.

Or drink until something happens.

I like girls more, you know, because we know the truth is like a dog. It can get out when no one's watching.
