# Humid Gig

The truth was like a dog. The wake wasn't frothy. The islands in the fog looked like fingerprint smears on a lens.

I don't like to think about superiority anymore.

To see a spark of joy extinguished is the worst thing. That's what always causes anything. Moving away from maleness reminds others of when their sparks of joy were extinguished. But you can relight it. No one tells them that.

You need to dry it it out first but you can relight it.

Or drink until something happens.

I like girls more, you know, because we know the truth is like a dog. It can get out when no one's watching.
