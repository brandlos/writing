# Different Travels

The truth was like a dog. The wake wasn't frothy. The islands in the fog looked like fingerprint smears on a lens. This is a northern-state story, in Maine.

One of them steered attentively, feet planted squarely forward at shoulder-width, peering between the radar screens with an underhand grip on a parallel two of the wheel's spokes--like you'd see in a movie, except he usually wore a pair of Skechers and glasses lassoed at the back with a nylon strap. This one I'm told once grazed the ferry sidelong against a bell buoy on a busy afternoon route. "Like, fully into it," I was told, "and then the rest of the day he'd tell anyone who would listen to him that he'd done it." If he docked ahead of schedule he liked to kill time by entertaining the passengers still on board. A friend and I watched him disrobe to his shorts and pull gainers off the dock into the bay just in front of us. I have to admit he was a bit of an exhibitionist and I did like it.

Another was older with a stiff and wiry frame, and would steer with one hand or even just a palm. He steered with a relaxed confidence that was easy to mistake for carelessness, though when our neighbor suffered a stroke while aboard I'm told (again, I wasn't there) he had everyone on the mainland within five minutes. I had to assume he brought the stool he would rest on during his shifts because I wouldn't see it anywhere in the hold on his off days, and I'm sure either of the other captains would have used it as well.

The third I knew by name but only met once, when he had come to cover another captain who'd had to leave the island early. He was a child, or at least younger than me. I saw a video of him steering the boat with his foot while he helped tied it to a post. In the video, you could only make out a leg and a foot poking through the window to reach the wheel, but I didn't recognize the limb so I knew it had to have been his.

There were plenty of deck hands; the position seemed to be seasonal or a day-by-day gig, something anyone could offer to work so long as they'd grown up in the area and could tie a bowline knot.

On the bus, the woman hauled her baby over each headrest. The baby whining more like a dog, her dog smelling more like a ferret. I was the one to offer her a spare seat when she wouldn't stop glancing side to side and sighing.

I was two-thirds through my trip, anyway. I'm trying not to look for applause here. My new seatmate wore a pink lampshade bucket hat and a pair of Sperrys over tie-dyed socks, and was muttering into his phone, "I ended up bribing her to get away from the Lyft. I said, 'Fuck him, I want to give you double. I've got twenty minutes'." His smell was at least something that might have attracted me otherwise.

I'll go back a bit, now. Where I was living was Cranberry Island.

To see a spark of joy extinguished is the worst thing. That's what always causes anything. Moving away from maleness reminds others of when their sparks of joy were extinguished. But you can relight it. No one tells them that.

You need to dry it it out first but you can relight it.

Or drink until something happens.

I like girls more, you know, because we know the truth is like a dog. It can get out when no one's watching.
